<H1> Caio VinÃ­cius :man_technologist: </H1>

Hi, my name is Caio, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Warren Brasil](https://warren.com.br).

Software engineer with 7 years of experience in back-end development mainly in the financial market. My work is focused on impacting the most customers by transforming code into value deliveries.

I write code mostly in C#, sometimes in Python.

I'm always trying to learn new things, currently I'm trying to delve into code practices and clean architecture and also in Cloud Computing using AWS.

Being proactive and organized has brought me great results on my journey. Also, I strongly believe in teamwork.
