<H1> Caio VinÃ­cius :man_technologist: </H1>

Hi, my name is Caio, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Warren Brasil](https://warren.com.br).

Enthusiastic developer with 7 years of experience in software development, mainly in the financial industry. I am delighted with the possibility of transforming code into valuable deliveries.

I'm always trying to learn new things, currently I'm trying to get deeper into code practices and clean architecture. In the current project I work on, I've been delving into the resources of AWS.

Being proactive and organized has brought me great results on my journey. I really believe in teamwork.
